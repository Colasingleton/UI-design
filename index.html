                    lives of our pets. At Pet Paradigm Professionals, our mission is to offer resources to help you 
                    care for your furry, scaly, feathery, and slimy loved ones. Our pet experts—or “Pexperts”—have 
                    been working with pet owners and professionals alike for the past twelve years. They offer 
                    one-on-one consultations with current and prospective pet owners as well as group presentations
