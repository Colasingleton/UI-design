          <h1>FAQ's</h1>
          <p><em>Our “Pexperts” typically encounter the following questions when
             consulting with prospective “pet parents:”</em></p>
          <h3>Question: What is the best way to rid my dog or cat of fleas?</h3>
          <p>Sometimes our furry friends pick up hitchhikers that make them very 
            itchy and uncomfortable. If gone unchecked, fleas can infest your home, 
            making it even more difficult to rid them from your loved one’s coat. 
            To eliminate fleas, choose a shampoo specially formulated to kill fleas 
            and be sure to read and follow all instructions on the label. Repeat 
            treatment as necessary until your pet is free of fleas; if you see
             skin irritation, stop use immediately and contact your local vet.</p>
          <h3>Question: How long can I expect my pet bird to live?</h3>
          <p>The answer can vary widely depending on the type of bird, the size, 
            the environment, and of course, mother nature. Assuming all is well
             in the external factors that are out of the owner's control, cockatiels
              and budgies live up to 20 years old on average. However, many parrot
               variations are known to live nearly an astounding 100 years! As with 
               many living organisms, longevity can be increased by keeping annual 
               veterinarian visits, maintaining a healthy diet, and keeping your
                feathery friend's environment sanitary.</p>
          <h3>Question: How often should I feed my pet snake?</h3>
          <p>Most snakes eat one to two times per week, depending on their age, 
            size, and activity level. Female snakes often increase their food 
            intake as breeding season gets underway. Some snakes can go as long 
            as two weeks before needing their next meal; this is normal. However,
             if your snake has not eaten in two or three weeks and seems lethargic,
              reach out to your local vet to determine if your snake might be ill or injured.</p>
